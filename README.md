# Bank Customer Churn Risk Dashboard Demo

This is the public client demo version of the Bank Customer Churn Risk Dashboard.

The dashboard displays prepared demo data, risk indicators, customer churn charts, high-risk customer tables, and downloadable demo reports. The import/upload feature is intentionally disabled in this public preview so visitors can inspect the dashboard experience without running private data through the model.

## Live Demo
